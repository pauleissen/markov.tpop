This is my Python 2.x implementation of the Markov chain algorithm
described in Kernighan and Pike's "The Practice of Programming"
(Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1999), Chapter 3, pp. 61-75.

./markov-tpop.py < TEXTFILE | fmt | more

Included with markov-tpop.py are following text files:
brooks.txt
empty.txt
one.txt
pridech1.txt
psalms.txt
three.txt
two.txt

Handling empty.txt, one.txt, and two.txt do NOT require any special-
purpose code in markov-tpop.py. (Thanks to K&P.)
