# Markov Chain Algorithm in Python

This is my Python 2.x implementation of the Markov chain algorithm
described in Kernighan and Pike's <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/" target="_blank">The Practice of Programming</a>
(Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1999), Chapter 3, pp. 61-75.

Usage:
    ./markov-tpop.py < TEXTFILE | fmt
    cat TEXTFILE | ./markov-tpop.py | fmt
where TEXTFILE is the name of a file containing English text.

Included with markov-tpop.py are several text files, including ones
that demonstrate that (thanks to K&P) markov-tpop.py does NOT require
any edge-case code to handle empty text files and files that contain
only one or two words.
